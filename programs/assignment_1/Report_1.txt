What is Orphan and Zombie processes?

Orphan process

A process which is running even after its parent process is finished running or terminated. It's called orphan because the process that created no longer exists.



Zombie process

A process which has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. It is also called defunct process. These process are said to be in the terminated state.


What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?

When a child process executes exec system call, it replaces the previous executable. It begins executing the new program from the begining so that 
the exec call doesn't encounter with an error. A new process is not created but the code, data, heap, and stack of the process is replaces with the new program.
